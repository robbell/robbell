### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Rob

I'm a Principal Software Engineer from London, working with distributed, high-scale systems and the teams that build them.

I have a number of personal projects, including [architecture visualisation][c4-diagrams], [static-site generation][hi-blog], [.NET templates for Kubernetes][k8s-template] and [games development][7drl].

I also occassionally write at [rob-bell.net][website].
